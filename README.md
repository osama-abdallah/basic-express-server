## My Notes

Today we did a basic server repo, we added logger and validation middleware, furthermore, we accessed the query object in the request object and named a property which we called name. I also created error handlers for the 404 and 500 statues.
All the following i tested them to make sure they work and what took the longest was to figure out how to do the esting for the bad method and bad path. The whole task took me around 6 hours not counting the time when i was stuck on the testing for the bad path and method.
